      "Don't get discouraged during the first couple of terms! The later co-ops tend to come easier with more experience. I personally have submitted over 500 applications on WaterlooWorks, eventually something will stick.",
      "Take pride in stuff that you have accomplished & listed on your resume",
      "join a design team",
      "take any interview you get even for practice, for software: Hackathons, Leetcode, Conferences, Projects, Passion",
      "Grind outside of school",
      "Grind side projects or join design teams",
      "Turn an interview into a conversation rather than them just asking the questions.",
      "Make connections!",
      "Apply more, get referrals",
      "Join design teams!",
      "Work on design teams and have a string portfolio",
      "Keep spam applying. Sometimes, it might just work. Also, don't neglect interview prep.",
      "Have friends in high places.",
      "linkedin connections!",
      "Be passionate about what you do. Don't do shit for the money or networking.",
      "Grind side projects & design teams, portfolio on resume, LinkedIn is pretty good",
      "Get involved with design teams or personal projects",
      "Reach out to interesting people on linkedin and chat about what they do, when there is a common interest, they are more likely to help you find a role somewhere at the company.",
      "Apply to jobs even if you think you're not qualified.",
      "Do a lot projects. Hackathons",
      "Work on your portfolio! Build it with projects",
      "Tailoring our resume to specific jobs, keeping a 'master list' of experiences/projects",
      "Join a design team in 1A and do as much work as you can with it. Specific, relevant experience on your resume is what will get you a job. The theory you learn in and out of class is only useful if you use it to do something.",
      "Your parents are Staff Engineers at Nvidia",
      "Don't be weird, shower before your interviews",
      "Grind hard early even during your current co-op",
      "Get your resume reviewed on r/EngineeringResumes / peers / mentors",
      "Make connections, everyone knows someone, and people want to help!",
      "do something outside of school worth talking about",
      "Spam apply with a portfolio",
      "Make a project portfolio, attach it with all applications. Being yourself is more important than being perfect in interviews.",
      "Your first one, try reaching out through as many avenues as possible. You want to cast a wide net. Same for applications on WaterlooWorks.",
      "If you want top tier jobs, be willing to work 'stepping stone' jobs in random cities that might not pay as well to gain relevant experience in that field. Dress well in interviews, tell stories, be very likeable. Work on your people and speaking skills. A lot of times even having 11/10 technical kowledge won't save you.",
      "Design Teams and Personal Projects - show off in your Portfolio, take a 'less desirable' first coop to build foundational skills such as manufacturing experience or drafting experience instead of jumping straight into design - you probably wont be a good designer at the start.",
      "Look at the job descriptions of jobs are you are interested in",
      "Get your LinkedIn in good shape and put it on your resume",
      "Join design teams. Show people you are interested and passionate through your actions not your words.",
      "Aim high, don't be afraid",
      "Have a cool portfolio with interesting and unique things, even if they aren't the most impressive things in the world.",

      "Fill out as many applications as you can. Have personal projects",
      "Work your ass off, put in the time to be technically competent, and be very thorough",
      "All experiences matter, try to do your research and put your best foot forward. You miss all shots you don't take so don't get intimidated and apply to everything you are interested in! Passion and willingness to learn matters more than proven experience",
      "Send emails and reach out to people at the companies/industries you're interested in ! Demonstrated interest goes so much further than just 'having a better resume'. I cannot stress the amount of hiring managers that have told me they'd much rather hire someone with good people skills and who's easy to work with than someone who is technically perfect for the job but lacking in people/interpersonal skills. You can teach/refine technical skills but you cannot change people's attitude/demeanour.",
      "Work on projects relevant to positions",
      "Get the look of your resume right, single column, no color, all black and white. Easy on the eyes of the recruiters. Get it reviewed a ton from senior trons and listen to what they say. If you wanna go to Cali, consistent design team involvement or URAs are the way to go",
      "Get gud",
      "just keep trying!",
      "interviewers want to hear you yap about something you're passionate about",
      "Be friendly in interviews, show that you're a real person and would be good to work with. Don't be afraid to ask questions during the interview and try to focus on or bring up your unique characteristics and differentiation from other candidates",
      "Contact engineers through linkedin",
      "Be at the right place at the right time. Join a design team and attend the design team specific recruiting events. Landed my last internship and full time job through these events.",
